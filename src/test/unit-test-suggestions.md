# Unit Test Suggestions for useHackerNewsSearch Hook

## What Should I Test For?

Based on the requirements in `instructions.md` and the current implementation of `useHackerNewsSearch`, the following areas should be covered in unit tests:

### Core Functionality
- **API Integration**: Test that the hook makes HTTP requests to the correct Hacker News API endpoint
- **Search Term Handling**: Verify that different search terms trigger appropriate API calls
- **Data Transformation**: Ensure the API response is properly transformed into the expected format
- **State Management**: Test that loading, error, and data states are managed correctly

### Data Processing (Per Requirements)
- **Filtering**: Verify that items without `url` or `relevancy_score` are filtered out
- **Sorting**: Ensure results are sorted by `relevancy_score` in descending order (higher scores first)
- **Data Structure**: Confirm returned objects have the correct shape: `{objectID, title, url, relevancy_score}`

### Error Scenarios
- **Network Errors**: Handle cases where the API request fails
- **Invalid Responses**: Deal with malformed JSON or unexpected response structures
- **Empty Results**: Handle cases where the search returns no results

### Performance & Edge Cases
- **Multiple Rapid Searches**: Test behavior when search terms change quickly
- **Empty Search Terms**: Verify behavior with empty or undefined search terms
- **Large Result Sets**: Ensure the hook handles large numbers of search results efficiently

## Unit Test Titles

### 1. Initial State Tests
- "should initialize with empty data, loading false, and no error"
- "should not make API call on initial mount with empty search term"

### 2. Search Functionality Tests
- "should make API call when search term is provided"
- "should construct correct API URL with search term"
- "should trigger new search when setSearchTerm is called"
- "should update URL state when search term changes"

### 3. Loading State Tests
- "should set loading to true when starting API request"
- "should set loading to false when API request completes successfully"
- "should set loading to false when API request fails"
- "should reset error state when starting new search"

### 4. Successful Response Tests
- "should update data with API response hits on successful request"
- "should set hasError to false on successful API response"
- "should filter out items without url property"
- "should filter out items without relevancy_score property" 
- "should sort results by relevancy_score in descending order"
- "should transform API response to expected data structure"

### 5. Error Handling Tests
- "should set hasError to true when API request fails"
- "should set hasError to true when response is not ok"
- "should log error to console when request fails"
- "should not update data when API request fails"
- "should handle network timeout errors"
- "should handle malformed JSON responses"

### 6. Edge Cases Tests
- "should handle empty search results gracefully"
- "should handle search term with special characters"
- "should handle rapid consecutive search term changes"
- "should handle undefined or null search terms"
- "should handle API response with missing hits property"

### 7. Integration Tests
- "should complete full search cycle from loading to data update"
- "should handle multiple searches in sequence correctly"
- "should maintain correct state transitions throughout search lifecycle"

## Testing Considerations

### Mocking Strategy
- Mock the `fetch` API to control response scenarios
- Use fake timers for testing loading states
- Mock console methods for error logging verification

### Test Data
- Create sample API responses that match Hacker News API structure
- Include edge cases like missing fields, empty arrays, and malformed data
- Test with various relevancy_score values for sorting verification

### Async Testing
- Use proper async/await patterns for testing hook effects
- Ensure all promises are resolved before assertions
- Test cleanup and cancellation of in-flight requests
